## Overview
This document outlines the requirements of this project, broken down into functional and non-functional

Functional requirements are usually expressed as a user-story for a defined user-persona, following the format:

- "I want to (be able to) \<action> so that I can \<business action>"

Non Functional requirements don't have a specific format. They include things like form factor, latency requirements, accessibility, and anything else that would constrain the problem space.

## Functional Requirements

### ðŸ‘¤ User Persona - Mapo Developer
- I want to see all the logs from both mapo-api and mapo-webapp, so that I can debug issues.

- I want to be able to search through logs, looking for specific keywords, so that I can find instances of a known issue (assuming I've logged something about that issue in code).

- I want to be able to set up watcher or alerts, so that I can be notified when a metric hits a threshold

- I want to be abel to see all my watchers in a single place, and see if they are all good, so taht I can quickly gauge the health of the system.

- I want to be able to see hardware metrics for Mapo infrastructure, so that I can right-size the infrastructure to save money.


### ðŸ‘¤ User Persona - Mapo Product Manager
- I want to see basic usage metrics, like number of users per day, so that I can tell whether people are actually using the application

- I want to be able to query for occurence rate of specific errors, so taht I can prioritize bugs and issues.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Cost. This solution shouldn't be too expensive. Mapo doesn't make any money, so ideally, the observablity stack would be cheap or free.

- Ease. This solution also shouldn't be too hard to maintain. I don't want to have to setup observability for my observability.
