## Overview
This document outlines the problems that initiated the creation of this project. 
It documents individual problem statements, broken down by user persona. 

You could format your problem descriptions like user-stories ("As an X, I would like to X, so that I can X, but X"), but often this data comes from user-interviews, and in that case it's best to just record exactly what was said.
